  ArangoDB v3.12 Release Notes New Features
archetype: default
---
The following list shows in detail which features have been added or improved in
ArangoDB 3.12. ArangoDB 3.12 also contains several bug fixes that are not listed
here.

## ArangoSearch

### WAND optimization (Enterprise Edition)

For `arangosearch` Views and inverted indexes (and by extension `search-alias`
Views), you can define a list of sort expressions that you want to optimize.
This is also known as _WAND optimization_.

If you query a View with the `SEARCH` operation in combination with a
`SORT` and `LIMIT` operation, search results can be retrieved faster if the
`SORT` expression matches one of the optimized expressions.

Only sorting by highest rank is supported, that is, sorting by the result
of a scoring function in descending order (`DESC`).

See [Optimizing View and inverted index query performance](../../index-and-search/arangosearch/performance.md#wand-optimization)
for examples.

This feature is only available in the Enterprise Edition.

## Analyzers



## Web interface

### Shard rebalancing

The feature for rebalancing shards in cluster deployments has been moved from
the **Rebalance Shards** tab in the **NODES** section to the **Distribution**
tab in the **CLUSTER** section of the web interface.

The updated interface now offers the following options:
- **Move Leaders**
- **Move Followers**
- **Include System Collections**

### Swagger UI

The interactive tool for exploring HTTP APIs has been updated to version 5.4.1.
You can find it in the web interface in the **Rest API** tab of the **SUPPORT**
section, as well as in the **API** tab of Foxx services and Foxx routes that use
`module.context.createDocumentationRouter()`.

The new version adds support for OpenAPI 3.x specifications in addition to
Swagger 2.x compatibility.

## AQL



## Server options

### LZ4 compression for values in the in-memory edge cache

<small>Introduced in: v3.11.2, v3.12.0</small>

LZ4 compression of edge index cache values allows to store more data in main
memory than without compression, so the available memory can be used more
efficiently. The compression is transparent and does not require any change to
queries or applications.
The compression can add CPU overhead for compressing values when storing them
in the cache, and for decompressing values when fetching them from the cache.

The new startup option `--cache.min-value-size-for-edge-compression` can be
used to set a threshold value size for compression edge index cache payload
values. The default value is `1GB`, which effectively turns compression
off. Setting the option to a lower value (i.e. `100`) turns on the
compression for any payloads whose size exceeds this value.
  
The new startup option `--cache.acceleration-factor-for-edge-compression` can
be used to fine-tune the compression. The default value is `1`.
Higher values typically mean less compression but faster speeds.

The following new metrics can be used to determine the usefulness of
compression:
  
- `rocksdb_cache_edge_inserts_effective_entries_size_total`: returns the total
  number of bytes of all entries that were stored in the in-memory edge cache,
  after compression was attempted/applied. This metric is populated regardless
  of whether compression is used or not.
- `rocksdb_cache_edge_inserts_uncompressed_entries_size_total`: returns the total
  number of bytes of all entries that were ever stored in the in-memory edge
  cache, before compression was applied. This metric is populated regardless of
  whether compression is used or not.
- `rocksdb_cache_edge_compression_ratio`: returns the effective
  compression ratio for all edge cache entries ever stored in the cache.

Note that these metrics are increased upon every insertion into the edge
cache, but not decreased when data gets evicted from the cache.

### Limit the number of databases in a deployment

<small>Introduced in: v3.10.10, v3.11.2, v3.12.0</small>

The `--database.max-databases` startup option allows you to limit the
number of databases that can exist in parallel in a deployment. You can use this
option to limit the resources used by database objects. If the option is used
and there are already as many databases as configured by this option, any
attempt to create an additional database fails with error
`32` (`ERROR_RESOURCE_LIMIT`). Additional databases can then only be created
if other databases are dropped first. The default value for this option is
unlimited, so an arbitrary amount of databases can be created.

## Miscellaneous changes

### In-memory edge cache startup options and metrics

<small>Introduced in: v3.11.4, v3.12.0</small>

The following startup options have been added:

- `--cache.max-spare-memory-usage`: the maximum memory usage for spare tables
  in the in-memory cache.
- `--cache.high-water-multiplier`: controls the cache's effective memory usage
  limit. The user-defined memory limit (i.e. `--cache.size`) is multiplied with
  this value to create the effective memory limit, from which on the cache tries
  to free up memory by evicting the oldest entries.

The following metrics have been added:

| Label | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `rocksdb_cache_edge_compressed_inserts_total` | Total number of compressed inserts into the in-memory edge cache. |
| `rocksdb_cache_edge_empty_inserts_total` | Total number of insertions into the in-memory edge cache for non-connected edges. |
| `rocksdb_cache_edge_inserts_total` | Total number of insertions into the in-memory edge cache. |

### RocksDB .sst file partitioning (experimental)

The following experimental startup options for RockDB .sst file partitioning
have been added:

- `--rocksdb.partition-files-for-documents`
- `--rocksdb.partition-files-for-primary-index`
- `--rocksdb.partition-files-for-edge-index`
- `--rocksdb.partition-files-for-persistent-index`

Enabling any of these options makes RocksDB's compaction write the 
data for different collections/shards/indexes into different .sst files. 
Otherwise, the document data from different collections/shards/indexes 
can be mixed and written into the same .sst files.

When these options are enabled, the RocksDB compaction is more efficient since
a lot of different collections/shards/indexes are written to in parallel.
The disavantage of enabling these options is that there can be more .sst
files than when the option is turned off, and the disk space used by
these .sst files can be higher.
In particular, on deployments with many collections/shards/indexes
this can lead to a very high number of .sst files, with the potential
of outgrowing the maximum number of file descriptors the ArangoDB process 
can open. Thus, these options should only be enabled on deployments with a
limited number of collections/shards/indexes.
