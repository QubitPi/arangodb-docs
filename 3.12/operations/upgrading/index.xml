See ArangoDB Editions for details.
To upgrade a deployment created with v3.12.5 or later from the Community Edition to the Enterprise Edition, all you need to do is to apply a license.
The rest of this page describes the upgrade procedure for Community Edition deployments created with v3.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading _Starter_ Deployments</title><link>http://localhost/3.12/operations/upgrading/starter-deployments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.12/operations/upgrading/starter-deployments/</guid><description>The ArangoDB Starter supports an automated procedure to perform upgrades, including rolling upgrades of a Cluster setup.
The upgrade procedure of the Starter described in this section can be used to upgrade to a new hotfix, or to perform an upgrade to a new minor version of ArangoDB. Please refer to the Upgrade paths section for detailed information.

If you have upgraded your ArangoDB package, and then also upgraded your current data directory, it is not supported to downgrade the package and start an older ArangoDB version on a data directory that was upgraded already.
If you are using a standalone ArangoDB server, data directory could have been upgraded automatically during package upgrade. If you are using the Starter to start your ArangoDB, and you have not triggered yet the rolling upgrade, or upgraded it manually, your data directory is (probably) still on the old version, so you should be able to downgrade the binaries in this case.</description></item></channel></rss>
