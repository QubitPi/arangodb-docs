Even though glibc is statically linked into the ArangoDB server and client tool executables, it may load additional modules at runtime that are installed on your system. Under rare circumstances, it is possible that ArangoDB crashes when performing host name or address lookups. This is only the case if all of the following conditions are true:</description></item><item><title>API Changes in ArangoDB 3.11</title><link>http://localhost/3.13/release-notes/version-3.11/api-changes-in-3-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.13/release-notes/version-3.11/api-changes-in-3-11/</guid><description>HTTP RESTful API Behavior changes Extended naming constraints for collections, Views, and indexes In ArangoDB 3.9, the --database.extended-names-databases startup option was added to optionally allow database names to contain most UTF-8 characters. The startup option has been renamed to --database.extended-names in 3.11 and now controls whether you want to use the extended naming constraints for database, collection, View, and index names.
The feature is disabled by default to ensure compatibility with existing client drivers and applications that only support ASCII names according to the traditional naming constraints used in previous ArangoDB versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
